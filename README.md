# PCA-Principle-Component-Analysis

PCA is a method in Machine learning which is used to reduce the number of variables in  large datasets, thereby reducing the dimensions of the data with an aim to retain as much data as possible. PCA reduces dimensionality and redundancy by combining original variables in a way that maximizes variance.
